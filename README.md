# Aaron Masseyâ€™s Vim Cheatsheet

This is my personal Vim helpfile that I use to jog my memory of various
commands that I use a little too infrequently.  This is based on [my vim
configuration][1].

## Installation

1. Copy this project to somewhere that Vim looks when loading plugins.
2. Reload plugins (or restart vim)
3. `:h cheat`
